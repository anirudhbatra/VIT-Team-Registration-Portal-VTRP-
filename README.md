# VIT-Team-Registration-Portal-(VTRP)
V 2.0

From being just a final project for my Data Structures Class to being actively used by my college for their fest registrations, VTRP is the project I am most proud of.
VTRP is a project that aims at providing an interface to make the team registrations during Gravitas and Riviera easier and less cumbersome. This system is highly reliable, cost effective and extensive within the area of deployment. This platform will be available for every user interface. This will reduce the work load of the organisers and coordinators by providing them the final list of the teams with all their details instead of giving them the list of each and every participant.
